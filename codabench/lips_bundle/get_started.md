## Aim of the LIPS benchmark

The LIPS benchmark is an extensible platform aiming at simplyfing the evaluation of simulators that address physical problems with an industrial dimensions.

Tested simulators can be either physical simulators or surrogate models.

The LIPS framework consists of three modules combining data management, surrogate models integration and evaluation metrics. The developed what about
platform is flexible and will allow to integrate progressively more benchmarks from other similar domains.

The LIPS platform is available as open-source on Github:
`https://github.com/Mleyliabadi/LIPS`

The instance of the LIPS platform running on Codabench primarily focuses on the Power Grid Use Case.
It aims at providing a fully-automated, reproductible environment to provide fair comparison between participants.
