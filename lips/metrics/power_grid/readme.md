# Power Grid specific metrics
This folder contains functions that compute power grid specific criteria. 

## Machine learning metrics
> __MAPE90 metric__ : It computes the Machine learning evaluation criteria using 10% of power grid elements presenting highest voltages. 

## Physics based metrics
> Joule's law

> Ohm's aw

> Kirchhoff's law (KCL)

> Law of conservation of energy (LCE)

> Power loss
