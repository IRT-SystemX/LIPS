class DoNothingAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    This is the most basic BaseAgent. It is purely passive, and does absolutely nothing.

    As opposed to most reinforcement learning environments, in grid2op, doing nothing is often
    the best solution.

        As better explained in the document of :func:`grid2op.BaseAction.update` or
        :func:`grid2op.BaseAction.ActionSpace.__call__`.

        The preferred way to make an object of type action is to call :func:`grid2op.BaseAction.ActionSpace.__call__`
        with the dictionary representing the action. In this case, the action is "do nothing" and it is represented by
        the empty dictionary.

        Parameters
        ----------
        observation: :class:`grid2op.Observation.Observation`
            The current observation of the :class:`grid2op.Environment.Environment`

        reward: ``float``
            The current reward. This is the reward obtained by the previous action

        done: ``bool``
            Whether the episode has ended or not. Used to maintain gym compatibility

        Returns
        -------
        res: :class:`grid2op.Action.Action`
            The action chosen by the bot / controller / agent.
